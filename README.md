# ai-recipes

A public collection of step-by-step AI workflows you can follow to produce real outcomes.

## Who this is for

Anyone who wants to replicate working AI workflows without starting from scratch. Recipes are written for non-technical users and focus on practical execution.

## Folder structure

Recipes are organized by category:

- `brand/` - Brand identity and design workflows
- `dev/` - Development and coding workflows
- `marketing/` - Marketing and content workflows
- `ops/` - Operations and process workflows
- `research/` - Research and analysis workflows
- `meta/` - Meta workflows for managing recipes themselves

Inside each category, recipes live in their own folders using kebab-case naming (e.g., `brand/nano-banana-brand-kit/`).

## How to use a recipe

1. Navigate to the recipe folder
2. Read `README.md` to understand what the recipe does and when to use it
3. Copy prompts from `prompts.md`
4. Follow the steps in `workflow.md` from start to finish

## Reuse and adaptation

These recipes are meant to be copied, modified, and adapted to your needs. Tools and models change frequently—update workflows as you discover improvements.
