# Purpose

This repository documents repeatable, outcome-driven AI workflows. All additions must be written as executable recipes, not theory, commentary, or prompt experiments.

# General principles

- Optimize for clarity and repeatability
- Assume a non-technical reader
- Prefer concrete steps over explanation
- Avoid hype, opinions, or model comparisons
- Keep language concise and neutral

# Folder structure

- All content lives under a top-level domain folder: brand, dev, marketing, ops, research, or meta
- Each recipe lives in its own folder using kebab-case naming
- Do not create new top-level folders without explicit instruction

# Required files per recipe

Every recipe folder must include:

## README.md

- What this recipe produces
- When to use it
- Expected outcome

## prompts.md

- Copy-paste-ready prompts only
- No commentary or analysis

## workflow.md

- Step-by-step execution order
- Clear tool transitions

# Optional files

- examples.md for sample outputs
- notes.md for edge cases or learnings

# Writing rules

- Short paragraphs or bullet points
- No emojis
- No em dashes
- No code snippets unless explicitly requested
- Do not repeat content across files

# Naming rules

- Recipe folders use descriptive kebab-case names
- File names are fixed and must not be altered
- Do not include tool names in top-level folders

# Scope control

- Do not introduce abstractions, frameworks, or theory
- Do not refactor existing recipes unless instructed
- Do not merge multiple outcomes into a single recipe

# Default behavior

When adding a new recipe:

- Place it in the correct domain folder
- Create required files
- Keep content minimal and executable
- Follow existing patterns exactly
