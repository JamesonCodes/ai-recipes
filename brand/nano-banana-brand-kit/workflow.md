# Workflow

## Step 1: Brand Discovery

1. Go to AI Studio
2. Prompt: "I need a complete brand kit. Business: [NAME]. What we do: [ONE SENTENCE]. Target: [WHO + PAIN]. Personality: [3 ADJECTIVES]. Interview me with 3-5 questions, include tagline ideas"
3. Replace the placeholders with your actual business information
4. Answer the 3-5 questions the AI asks

## Step 2: Logo Generation

1. After answering the interview questions, prompt: "Use Nano Banana Pro to generate 4 logo options in a 2x2 grid"
2. Review the 4 logo options
3. Select the best logo
4. Request variations by prompting: "Generate [secondary/monochrome black/white/icon-only] variations of the selected logo"
5. Repeat for each variation type needed

## Step 3: Brand Kit Slides

1. Prompt: "Generate the logo system slide for my brand kit deck"
2. Prompt: "Outline the remaining slides for my brand kit deck"
3. For each slide in the outline, prompt: "Generate [slide name/topic] for my brand kit deck"
4. Generate each slide one at a time

## Step 4: Assembly and Export

1. Open Google Slides
2. Create a new presentation
3. Copy each generated slide content from AI Studio
4. Paste into Google Slides, creating one slide per generated section
5. Insert logo images where appropriate
6. Go to File > Download > PDF Document
7. Save as `[brand-name]-brand-kit.pdf`

## Pro Tip

Use the prompt pattern to get consistent outputs from Nano Banana every time: "interview me → generate one asset → outline remaining assets → generate"
